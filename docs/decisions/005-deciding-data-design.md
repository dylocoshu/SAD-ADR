# Deciding on the Data Design.

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to be able to choose the correct way to display my Data Design

## Considered Options
I have only considered using the Entity Relationship Diagram for my Database Design.

## Decision Outcome

 I have chosen " Entity Relationship Diagram "
* Very good clarity, and can clearly see how tables relate to one another
* Due to its clarity, seeing how services function and interact with the database is alot easier.
* Encourages normalizationa and reduces data redundancy

## Consequences

* Good, because it accurately depics the interaction between the Component Diagram and UI.
* Bad, because any changes to the system will cause more maintenance for the ERD.
