# Establishing the Architectural Style in both Container Diagrams.

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to be able to choose the right tool to display my User Interaction

## Considered Options

* Photoshop
* FIGMA

## Decision Outcome

 I have chosen " FIGMA "

## Consequences

* Heavily caters towards Web Development
* Has multiple tutorials on YouTube on Web Design using this tool
* As mentioned previously, comes with features which aid the process of design each web page to display the process of the VISA Application
* Exports in high quality images.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Photoshop
* I have experience with photoshop already
* Great export options
* Not very good for Web Design though; more catered towards creating or editing images and photos. Would be useful for editing images for a fleshed out prototype.
* Would take longer to achieve what FIGMA can achieve.
