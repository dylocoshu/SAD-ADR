# Using Draw IO for Context and Container Diagram

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to be able to display the architecture of the system and its different levels (System Context and Container ) correctly and efficiently.

## Considered Options

* [FIGMA] (https://www.figma.com) Free Designing Tool
* [Draw.IO] (https://app.diagrams.net/) Free Designing Tool alot more catered towards Software Architecture Design.
* [Photoshop] (https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop/) Professional Designing Tool

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: "Draw.IO", because:

* It is very efficient in the goal I want to accomplish
* Has readily available templates which can be used to display the C4 Model in a nice and presentable fashion. A lot of the templates and pre-made designs already cater towards SAAD.
* Very easy ways of exporting the models.


### Consequences

* Good, because it has everything necessary to design the C4 Model
* Neutral, because I have to learn draw.io

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Photoshop

* Good, because I am also very familiar with Photoshop already
* Neutral, because it mainly caters towards ( as mentioned in the name ) editing photos rather than aiding in design through diagrams etc.
* Bad, because it costs a lot of money and only free through a trial.
* Bad, because it lacks elements which FIGMA and Draw.IO succeed in for this project.

### FIGMA

* Good, because I am familiar with the tool already
* Good, because it has features (such as components) which I can use to speed up the design process
* Neutral, because it doesnt have the templates Draw.IO has.
