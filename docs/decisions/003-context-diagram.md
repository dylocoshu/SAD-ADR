# Establishing the Systems in the Context Diagram.

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to be able to display the architecture of the system and its different levels (System Context and Container ) correctly and efficiently.

## Considered Options

Didn't need to consider any other options, External Systems and the System name were decided already from the Brief and Requirements Document.

## Decision Outcome

I decided to go with two different Context Diagrams to depict both Applicant and Staff interaction with the System
Both have Email System and VIA API Interaction, however Applicant has Payment Service.

* Both users will need to have access to the Email System for communication with the System, and to get VISA Information


### Consequences

* Good, because it accurately depics the users interaction with the system

## Pros and Cons of the Options

No noticeable pros and cons.
