# Using FIGMA for Context and Container Diagram

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to be able to display the architecture of the system and its different levels (System Context and Container ) correctly and efficiently.

## Considered Options

* [FIGMA] (https://www.figma.com) Free Designing Tool
* [Draw.IO] (https://app.diagrams.net/) Free Designing Tool alot more catered towards Software Architecture Design.
* [Photoshop] (https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop/) Professional Designing Tool

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: "FIGMA", because:

* It is a designing tool I am already very familiar with.
* A very lean design tool; not convoluted and everything necessary is easily accessible and ready to use
* The Components function which allows for customizable templates, reducing repetitiveness when creating mulitple boxes
* The Styles function which allows for customizable text styles to be used repeatedly, similar to the Components.


### Consequences

* Good, because I wont have to take the time to learn this tool. Anything I picture, can be made without any struggle to create or find using FIGMA.


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Draw IO

* Good, because it has readily available templates which can be used to display the C4 Model in a nice and presentable fashion. A lot of the templates and pre-made designs already cater towards SAAD.

### Photoshop

* Good, because I am also very familiar with Photoshop already
* Neutral, because it mainly caters towards ( as mentioned in the name ) editing photos rather than aiding in design through diagrams etc.
* Bad, because it costs a lot of money and only free through a trial.
* Bad, because it lacks elements which FIGMA and Draw.IO succeed in for this project.
